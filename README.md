# Android 5.1 on Microsoft Surface 2
Welcome! This repository aims to show how to build and flash Android 5.1 on a Microsoft Surface 2 device. You can check out the guide [here](Guide.md).

## Pre-built images
A pre-built SD card image, as well as files for the USB flash drive, are available for download [here](https://files.open-rt.party/android/android-5.1-surface2-sdcard.zip). However, they may be out-of-date and not reflect the current development state. Follow the last parts of the [guide](Guide.md) to flash Android to your SD card and prepare your USB flash drive.

## Status
Currently, everything works except:
- Bluetooth
- Camera
- Power management
